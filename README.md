# vim-rockstar

A vim filetype and syntax highlighting plugin for the esoteric
[Rockstar](https://github.com/dylanbeattie/rockstar)
programming language.

## Installation with Vundle

There are many ways to manage your vim plugins, but I prefer Vundle.
If you're using Vundle, just add

```
Plugin 'sirosen/vim-rockstar'
```

to your vimrc and do the typical Vundle install step.
